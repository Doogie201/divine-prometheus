  # This hook is configured to work with ESLint v9's flat config system
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    # Crucially, pin to an ESLint 9 compatible revision.
    # You might need to experiment or check mirrors-eslint's releases for the latest stable that bundles ESLint 9.
    # As of current knowledge, `v9.2.9` (or newer if available) should support ESLint 9.

    hooks:
      - id: eslint

        # Pass the config file explicitly, targeting the new CommonJS file
        entry: eslint
        args:
          - "--config"
          - "eslint.config.cjs" # Point to the renamed CommonJS config file
          - "--fix" # Optional: enable auto-fixing for lint errors
        # Language is javascript, but it will process TS/TSX due to ESLint config and parser
        language: node
        # Add all dependencies that your eslint.config.cjs imports or extends from
        # These will be installed in the isolated pre-commit.ci environment for the hook.
